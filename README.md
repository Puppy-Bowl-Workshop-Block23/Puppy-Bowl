Development Branch - - - 

- This branch (development) is where all our code will go, once were done with our own feature branch

- So essentially were creating another feature/branch and then merge it, into this one the "Development Branch"

- In which, when this project is done done, we will merge the "Development Branch" into the main 



Recap - - 
- create your own feature/branch  (ex. feature/getAll-RenderAll)
- when done with your feature and its good to go, merge it to the development branch
- when where all done with our features, and code looks good, well merge the development branch to the main branch
- we will submit our main branch for this Block 23 Workshop for grading
